Sure! Here's a simple Python application starter and manager. This will let you manage different Python applications (scripts or services) from one centralized place. The app will allow you to start, stop, and monitor the processes.

Key Features:
Start a Python application (script).
Stop a running application.
List all running applications.
Monitor the status of running applications.
Step 1: Install dependencies
You need psutil to manage processes. Install it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install psutil
Step 2: Create the application (app_manager.py)
python
Copy
Edit
import os
import psutil
import subprocess
import time

class AppManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.running_apps = {}

    def start_application(self, script_name):
        """Starts a Python application script."""
        if script_name in self.running_apps:
            print(f"{script_name} is already running!")
            return

        try:
            process = subprocess.Popen(['python', script_name], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
            self.running_apps[script_name] = process
            print(f"Started {script_name} with PID {process.pid}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error starting {script_name}: {e}")

    def stop_application(self, script_name):
        """Stops a running Python application script."""
        if script_name not in self.running_apps:
            print(f"{script_name} is not running!")
            return

        process = self.running_apps[script_name]
        process.terminate()
        del self.running_apps[script_name]
        print(f"Stopped {script_name} with PID {process.pid}")

    def list_running_apps(self):
        """Lists all running Python application scripts."""
        if not self.running_apps:
            print("No applications are currently running.")
        else:
            for app, process in self.running_apps.items():
                print(f"{app} (PID: {process.pid})")

    def monitor_apps(self):
        """Monitors the status of running applications."""
        while True:
            for app, process in list(self.running_apps.items()):
                if process.poll() is not None:  # Process has finished
                    print(f"{app} has stopped.")
                    del self.running_apps[app]
            time.sleep(5)

def main():
    manager = AppManager()

    while True:
        print("\nApplication Manager")
        print("1. Start an application")
        print("2. Stop an application")
        print("3. List running applications")
        print("4. Monitor applications")
        print("5. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            script_name = input("Enter the script name to start: ")
            manager.start_application(script_name)

        elif choice == "2":
            script_name = input("Enter the script name to stop: ")
            manager.stop_application(script_name)

        elif choice == "3":
            manager.list_running_apps()

        elif choice == "4":
            manager.monitor_apps()

        elif choice == "5":
            print("Exiting Application Manager.")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
AppManager Class:

start_application: Starts a Python application (script) as a subprocess.
stop_application: Terminates a running process.
list_running_apps: Lists all the running applications and their process IDs.
monitor_apps: Keeps checking the status of running applications, removing them from the list if they have finished.
main function:

Provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the app manager.
Usage:
Save this code in a file called app_manager.py.
Run the app using python app_manager.py.
You can:
Start applications (e.g., python my_script.py).
Stop them.
List all running applications.
Monitor them in the background.
Example Interaction:

Edit
Application Manager
1. Start an application
2. Stop an application
3. List running applications
4. Monitor applications
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the script name to start: my_script.py
Started my_script.py with PID 12345

Application Manager
1. Start an application
2. Stop an application
3. List running applications
4. Monitor applications
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 3
my_script.py (PID: 12345)
This starter application can be expanded with more advanced features like logging, error handling, or even running applications in the background. ðŸŽ‰
